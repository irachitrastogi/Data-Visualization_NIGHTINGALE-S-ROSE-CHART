**Data Visualization_NIGHTINGALE'S ROSE CHART**

- The visualization is of nightingale rose chart. For this, I have used D3.js which is one of the finniest library 	      that is available for visualization. Other things used are HTML (HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE), CSS (CASCADING STYLE SHEET) and JavaScript. 
- For this the entire data was first stored in a JSON format with information about date, army size, disease, wounds and others. 
- This data was then used to represent two different visualizations, one starting from April 1854 to March 1855.

	This can be viewed by going to the following link: https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~rrastogi/nightingaleRose.html


  **1st Representation**

- The Green area represents demise due to “disease” followed by Red – showing “wounds” and finally Blue due to “other” happenings.
- The visualization is even dynamic as I have added a time delay concept while representing both the  charts. 
- The other rotated visualization is of data starting from April 1855 to March 1856.
- This is a “rotated” as well as “zoomed” representation showing again the same form of data i.e. the deaths due to three factor. Here also the I have made it a little dynamic by adding the delay in representation.
- A mouse hover on any of the area in the chart gives the number of people died in the given region.

How to run the code: 

- To run the code locally, Download XAMPP (free and open-source cross-platform web server) and place all the files at the root of the folder.
	To download XAMPP : https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html - vist the link 
- You can check from the settings folder the port to which the local host i assigned to. 
- For me, it was: http://localhost:8080/nightingaleRose.html
- Ultimately you will have your local setup ready. 
- We can also follow the same steps to run it on any server (AWS or Firebase), just make sure that it has any application to publish your work as XAMPP.
